Hello Everyone.
Meet our team.
Koren Sanger.
Ron Popov.
Or Navon.
Shai Kimhi.
And I - Yotam Salmon.
We made a device, called EyePer.
This device is an extension to a wheelchair, that can help a paralyzed person with interacting with the world around them.
It uses eye recognition to make everyday devices accessible for handicapped people.
It can be used to speak, or write full sentences and read them later, like I'm doing now.
It can be used to turn on lights, operate air condition system or watch TV.
This device can be revolutionary in the aspect of accessibility.
We hope it can lead to a change in the attitude towards paralyzed people and ALS.
Thank you,
We were the EyePer team.
